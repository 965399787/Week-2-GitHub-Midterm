    <h1>"Why Programming?"</h1>
    <p> I'm going to become old, crippled and ultimately die one day.</p>
    <p> Therefore, my biggest goal in life is to leave a long lasting impression, the same way my heros left an impression on me</p>
    <p> My heroes are not people, but video games. Zelda, Pokemon, and (unfortunately) League of Legends distracted me for years from the fear of growing up. </p>
    <p> To be judgemental, hard-working, lacking any appreciation for life and the details which makes our lives worth enjoying.</p>
    <h2> "So Why don't I just make my job fun?"</h2>
    <p> This is why I chose programming, to be the bridge between exploring everything I grew up with, understanding the development of future technology, and make some stupid video games along the way. </p>
